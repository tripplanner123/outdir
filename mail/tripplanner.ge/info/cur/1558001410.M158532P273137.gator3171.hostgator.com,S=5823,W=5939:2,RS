Good Day,

Thank you for contacting TripAdvisor Experiences Support. I see that you wa=
nt to understand further about the Product Liability Insurance. I will be m=
ore than happy to assist you.

I reviewed your product Martvili and Okatse Canyons Full Day Tour (130729P1=
8). Since this product offers boat ride for the travelers, TripAdvisor enco=
urages you to have Product Liability Insurance for any water or air tours, =
like helicopter flights, hot air balloon rides, sky diving, cruises, sailin=
g tours, scuba diving, etc. as it is considered to be "High Risk activities=
".=C2=A0

Any aspect of a product includes an air or water component (ex. a historica=
l tour where you take a ferry), you need to provide Product Liability Insur=
ance documentation, regardless if you operate the air or water component of=
 the activity

You may also check our this link for more details about Product Liability I=
nsurance: https://supplier.viator.com/faq/article/What-do-I-need-to-know-ab=
out-public-liability-insurance

Please feel free to send us an email if you have any questions.

Best regards,
