Hello George,

We don't cover meals for people, they pay for themself however we would
like to have 2 times traditional dinner in the family house or something
like that. We have our own guide who was already in Georgia, couse our
group can't speak in English we need to provide them polish speaker
guide.
However we would like to meet with someone in Tibilisi and go for a tour
around the city and traditional dinner.
In previous emial you send cost of transportation 225 + 280 + 225 = 730$
Please write me more about cost of wine degustation and tickets for what
we should pay and recalculate the sum.

Greetings
Damian
