       Marketplace notification      === Holibob has proposed a contract
with you. ===

 Dear Trip Panner Holibob is an aggregator / channel manager of activities
and experiences and we would like to offer you a partnership. As a channel
manager we push your activities / experiences to online travel agents,
airlines, cruise resellers and e-commerce platforms who then sell your
products to their end customers. This means that you have significant more
exposure to European customers and ultimately generates you more sales. We
charge a commission on each sale you make, this is 20%. We already have a
large number of suppliers signed up and we think that your products could
be very popular and fit within our partners requirements. Having reviewed
your activities / experiences, we think you have a lot to offer and this
would be attractive to the end customer when booking their next holiday.
Should you have any questions, comments or concerns please do not hesitate
to contact me directly. Otherwise if you are willing to partner with
Holibob, please accept the agreement sent over and we look forward to
working with you. Calum Booth Supplier Relations Executive @ Holibob The
