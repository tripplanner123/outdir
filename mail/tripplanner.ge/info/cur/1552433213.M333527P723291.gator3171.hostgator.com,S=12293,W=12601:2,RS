Hello!

Thank you for your answer, that sound's really good. And the bus that
you provide has AC and it's comfortable for the group?
I'm really interesting in your tour, can you explain me how it is
organised, what is included? What you can recommedn for the group if we
arrive for 10 days? Let's say they want to visit Tbilisi/Mtskheta and
also stay for 2 nights in Bordzomi with trip around and then stay 4-5
days in Batumi with 2 or 3 trips around. What's the best option that you
can recomend and how much it will cost?

How we can be sure that all that we choose you gonna provide in those
price you wrote? Are we going to sign an arrangement? 

Thanks in advance!
