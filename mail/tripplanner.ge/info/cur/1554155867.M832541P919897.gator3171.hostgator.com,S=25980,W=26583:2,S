Let's say we gonna organise a trip for 25 people, 10 days. First we need to pick up from Kutaisi airport to Tibilili, then we spend 2 days in the city and we gonna move to borjomi and batumi, on the road I hope it's possible to see something. On the last day we need pick up to Kutaisi airport. I'm asking about the price couse we don't know how much it is but if we will organise this kind of trip we would like to know the cost of transportation.
